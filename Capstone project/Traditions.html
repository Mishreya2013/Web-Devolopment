    <h2><strong>🌸 Hanami, 花見(Cherry Blossom Viewing) </strong>-
    Each spring, Japan transforms into a canvas of soft pink as cherry blossoms bloom across the country. Hanami, the tradition of flower viewing, is more than a picnic under trees—it’s a celebration of fleeting beauty. Families and friends gather beneath sakura petals, sharing food, laughter, and quiet reflection. The blossoms, lasting only a few days, remind us of life’s impermanence and the importance of cherishing each moment.


   <h2><strong>🏮 Obon Festival </strong>-
Obon is a sacred time when the boundary between the living and the dead grows thin. Families light lanterns to guide ancestral spirits home, offering food and prayers in their honor. Towns come alive with Bon Odori dances, where graceful movements echo centuries of remembrance. It’s a festival of connection—between generations, between worlds, and between memory and celebration. </h2>


<h2><strong>🌌 Tanabata,  (Star Festival) </strong>-
Inspired by a legend of star-crossed lovers separated by the Milky Way, Tanabata is a festival of wishes. On July 7th, people write their hopes on colorful strips of paper and hang them on bamboo branches, creating vibrant trees of dreams. The tradition blends romance, mythology, and personal aspiration, turning city streets into constellations of human longing.</h2>
