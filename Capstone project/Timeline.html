    <h1><center>Japanese Timeline</center></h1>
    <br>
    <h2> Summary</h2>
    <h3> Japan's timeline begins with the prehistoric Jomon period (c. 10,000–300 BCE), followed by the introduction of wet rice cultivation in the Yayoi period (c. 300 BCE–300 CE). The Kofun and Asuka periods saw the unification of Japan and the introduction of Buddhism. The classic Nara (710–794 CE) and Heian (794–1185 CE) periods established the imperial court. A feudal system emerged with the establishment of the first shogunate during the Kamakura period (1185–1333 CE). The Edo period (1603–1868 CE) was characterized by isolation and a capital at Edo (Tokyo). Meiji (1868–1912), Taisho (1912–1926), and Showa (1926–1989) periods marked rapid industrialization, expansion, and eventual devastation from World War II. The Heisei (1989–2019) and Reiwa periods have seen the rise of technological development and recovery from major natural disasters. </h3>
